<h4>Getting Started:</h4><br />
<p>Installing WebEngine CMS is very easy. During the setup process, the installer will help you make sure your web server meets the specified requirements to run the CMS. If you are installing the CMS in a shared web hosting account, make sure your hosting provider allows outgoing remote connections to your Microsoft SQL server port (usually port 1433).</p>

<br />

<h4>Support:</h4><br />
<p>If you are having trouble completing the setup process, feel free to reach out to us in our community support forum and/or discord. If additional help is required, feel free to contact us regarding our WebEngine Premium Support service.</p>
